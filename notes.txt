== Initial brainstorming of project ==
1. Researched previous implementations of the sequence to see what does and does not work and why.
2. Decided on web app as it is not much more difficult and is much more user friendly.
3. Considered extensions to the base project that were both reasonable to complete and productive/added value. more ideas will come as project progresses.
4. Decided initial proof of concept and algorithm would be fleshed out via commandline tool.

== Project work ==
1. Work environment setup
2. Initial implementation of research findings, functions but does not return expected value
3. Additional testing uncovers results are shifted one position, such that F(4) yields F(5)



== chicken scratch ==

F(0) = 0 and F(1) = 1 
(Ex]   F(3) = F(2) + F(1) = 1 + 1 = 2
F(6) = F(5) + F(4) = 5 + 3 = 8

6
hash[6]
hash[6] = (hash[5] = hash[4] + hash[3]) + (hash[4] = hash[3] + hash[2])
