== Initial brainstorming of project ==
1. Researched previous implementations of the sequence to see what does and does not work and why.
2. Decided on web app as it is not much more difficult and is much more user friendly.
3. Considered extensions to the base project that were both reasonable to complete and productive/added value. more ideas will come as project progresses.
4. Decided initial proof of concept and algorithm would be fleshed out via commandline tool.

== Project work ==
1. Work environment setup
2. Initial implementation of research findings, functions but does not return expected value
3. Additional testing uncovers results are shifted one position, such that F(4) yields F(5)
4. Scrapped initial design and switched to loop and hash object combo
5. Took some basic steps to ensure type safety with the function input so it is always an int
6. Basic tests show expected output is received
7. Time trials confirm function works to spec, and progress is stored between runs in the same session



== chicken scratch ==

F(0) = 0 and F(1) = 1 
(Ex]   F(3) = F(2) + F(1) = 1 + 1 = 2
F(6) = F(5) + F(4) = 5 + 3 = 8
